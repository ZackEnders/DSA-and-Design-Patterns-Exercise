# Week 0

All of these topics will be mentioned in articles / videos throughout the learning material for Data Structures and Design Patterns. It's important to know the basics of these topics before getting into the code. Referring back to these topics each week to keep them fresh and gain a deeper understanding of each one would be a good idea.

## S.O.L.I.D and other Programming Principles

I've included articles that also contradict the SOLID principles. Make sure to check them out! Lots of very smart people have different opinions about SOLID and other principles, so don't get too caught up on these. At the end of the day the goal is to write clean and maintainable code.

## Big-O Notation

Big-O Notation is a pretty important topic when it comes to Data Structures and Algorithms. Make sure you have a good grasp on the basics of the Big-O analysis before week 1.

You'll also find that there are `Big-θ (Big-Theta) notation` and `Big-Ω (Big-Omega) notation`. These two are worth reading about but not something you should deep dive into at this time (unless you really want).

## Basic Data Structures

Just knowing how to work with Arrays and Strings is going to be really beneficial for this exercise. Make sure you understand the methods that are available for each Data Structure. If you want to deep dive / go above and beyond on how these are stored in JS then feel free to do so.
